   - UserBar



   NavigationBar will contain links to the IndexPage, SearchCategoriesPage, and CreateCampaignPage. May also have other links to HowItWorksPage and EarlyOfferingsPage.

   When the Explore Page link is hovered over, it shows the ExploreCategoriesList: a list of all categories of campaigns. Clicking on a category will take you to the SearchCategoriesPage with that category preselected.

   SearchBar will allow the user to search for campaigns, taking them to the SearchCategoriesPage.


---
**UserBarContainer**
   - SignUp
   - LogIn
   - UserDropDown



   UserBar will either display Sign Up/Sign In buttons if there is no current user, or the user's username with a UserDropDown displayed on click.

   When a user clicks on the Sign Up or Sign In buttons, it dispatches the addContentToModal action with the SignUp or LogIn components, which renders a SignUp or LogIn modal on top of the page.

   The UserDropDown contains links to a user's created campaigns, contributions, profile, and settings. It also allows the user to log out.

   - FeaturedCarouselItems



   FeaturedCarousel renders 5 FeaturedCarouselItems on load, and cycles through them automatically, or on user click.

---
**TileCarouselContainer**
   - TileCarouselHeader
   - TileCarouselArrow
   - TileGroup

   TileCarouselHeader controls what Tiles are displayed in the TileGroup. You can choose to show tiles that are trending, popular near you, or that are specific to the tech or creative sector by clicking on the headers shown. Each of these headers dispatches an AJAX request to the server and returns the Tiles for the TileGroup.

   TileCarouselArrow allows you to cycle through the Tiles shown in the TileGroup, four at a time. Direction of the scroll is passed as a prop so that we don't have to create two components.

 ---

---
**CheckOutPageContainer**
   - CheckOutUser



   Won't have many components, only the CheckOutUser component that displays the current user and a Log Out button. Mainly just a massive form to take in payment/shipping information.

   The form changes depending on whether or not the user got to the page from a Perk or from the DonationBar. If from a Perk, it displays the perk and it's cost. It also displays a "Shipping Address" section. If from the DonationBar, it displays the amount originally inputted as "Your Contribution", but has a link back to the CampaignShowPage so that the user can go back and select a Perk if they wish.
